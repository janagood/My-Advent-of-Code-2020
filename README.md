# My-Advent-of-Code-2020
my solutions cleaned up (mostly) - if you have questions, email me janagood@kc.rr.com
   or comment on reddit (well, if i ever post anything on reddit)
   
   there aren't many comments in my code - i mostly hate them - feel the code should speak for itself

dream is to post everyday with nice code -- but that's not going to happen because:
  you know - Christmas, grandkids, covid, ...

and no way i'll ever stay up 'til 11 and code stuff because:

tried it once this year - saw how to do right away - typed it in my template
  literally start to finish both parts under 5 minutes and number 8,000 or something 

so leaderboard will never happen for me, sigh...  oh well don't really care since there's no t-shirt involved
